A browser extension that automatically answers polleverywhere questions.

**Installation Process**

1) Download the code or clone the repository. If you download, make sure to unzip the folder.
2) Open up chrome
3) type in "chrome://extensions" into the search bar and press enter
4) turn on developer mode (should be the toggle on the top right)
5) click "Load Unpacked" (should be the button on the top left)
6) click on the folder that contains the code you just downloaded (should be named "WinEverywhere")
7) turn off developer mode.

you're done!

**Turning it On or Off**

1) click the WinEverywhere icon (top right, looks like a 'W')
2) click manage extensions
3) turn WinEverywhere on or off.

**Using it**

Once Installation is complete, you can open a tab with 'pollev.com/whatever123'. You must sign in if you aren't already signed in. You can minimize this tab. The extension will continue to automatically answer any multiple choice questions on any polleverywhere chrome tab. If youter close the tab, the extension will stop answering questions.

**Notes**

This extension can only modify and read data on sites with the 'pollev.com' prefix.
This extension currently answers questions randomly. This is great if you just want any answer (i.e. the actual answer doesn't matter, the poll is for participation purposes), but not so great if you want the 'correct' answer.
